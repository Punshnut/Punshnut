Hi, I’m Jan 👋

I build small macOS apps with intention -
tools that feel calm, respectful, and thoughtfully made.
Currently focused on macOS utilities that reduce visual and cognitive noise.

Good software doesn’t demand attention.
It supports focus, reduces friction, and quietly does its job.

macOS is the platform I work on and build for.
My goal is to create native-feeling apps that fit naturally into everyday workflows.
Alongside software, I work as a freelance filmmaker and photographer,
guided by kindness, creativity, and inclusion.
