Hi, I’m Jan 👋

I build small macOS apps with intention -
tools that feel calm, respectful, and thoughtfully made.

Good software doesn’t demand attention.
It supports focus, reduces friction, and quietly does its job.

macOS is the platform I work on and build for.
My goal is to create native-feeling apps that fit naturally into everyday workflows.

Alongside software, I work as a freelance filmmaker and photographer,
guided by kindness, creativity, and inclusion.
